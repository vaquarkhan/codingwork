  --[no-]allow-started-ignored           Fire test started before the execution of a
                                         step. This makes it possible to use the
                                         test started and test finished notification
                                         to calculate the execution time of the step.
                                         If the step is pending the test started will
                                         be followed by a test ignored, which can
                                         confuse some listeners.
  --[no-]filename-compatible-names       Make sure that the names of the test cases
                                         only is made up of [A-Za-Z0-9_] so that the
                                         names for certain can be used as file names.
                                         For instance gradle will use these names in 
                                         the file names of the JUnit xml report files.
